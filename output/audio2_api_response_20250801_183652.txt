Okay, I understand. Based on your description, here's a breakdown of the process you're outlining, attempting to clarify the steps and highlighting potential areas where more information would be helpful:

**Goal:** Debunking (likely investigating/adjusting/correcting) a "Closing Stock C3 journey". This implies there's a process or record associated with closing stock (inventory) related to something called "C3 journey."

**Steps:**

1. **Open the Manage Partners Module:** This suggests you're using a software system with a "Manage Partners" module.  This likely relates to managing relationships with vendors, suppliers, or other related business entities.

2. **Search for the Open One:**  This is vague. "The Open One" refers to a specific partner record in the module that is currently active or unresolved.  We need more information to identify which partner you are looking for. What criteria are you using? (e.g., Partner Name, ID, Status, etc.)

3. **Search for the End Term:** This also requires more context. "End Term" could refer to the contract end date, payment terms, or other defined periods associated with the partner agreement.

4. **Click Search Button:**  After entering search criteria (partner and "End Term"), you execute the search.

5. **Click Update Stock Button:** This implies that the partner record has a direct link to stock or inventory management. This button updates the stock level for that partner.

6. **Click:** This is incomplete.  Click what? You need to specify which button, link, or option you are clicking within the "Update Stock" context.

7. **Click NNI SKV and then be in variance:**  This is also unclear.  "NNI SKV" is likely a specific identifier or code (perhaps a product code or a stock-keeping unit).  "Be in variance" suggests that, upon clicking "NNI SKV," the system detects a discrepancy between expected and actual stock levels.

8. **Click the last button and then click:** Again, this lacks crucial information. Which is the last button? What does it mean to click this button?

**Potential Problems and Clarifications Needed:**

* **Identify "The Open One":** You need a clear method to identify which partner record you are searching for.  Is there a specific status, date range, or other unique identifier?
* **Clarify "End Term":**  What specific "End Term" are you searching for? Is it a date? A status? A specific agreement?
* **Specify Buttons:** Steps 6 and 8 are incomplete. You must specify which buttons you are clicking. This is critical for understanding the intended action.
* **Define "NNI SKV":** What does this code refer to? What happens when you click on it?  Does it display details about the stock variance?
* **System Context:**  Knowing the name of the software system you're using would significantly improve understanding.

**General Approach to Debunking (Assuming Stock Variance):**

Given the clues, I'm guessing the core process involves:

1. **Identifying the Partner:** Locate the relevant partner in the system.
2. **Checking Contract Terms:** Verify the agreed-upon "End Term" for that partner's stock provisions.
3. **Updating Stock:** Access the "Update Stock" functionality for that partner.
4. **Investigating Variance:** When "NNI SKV" triggers a variance, the process should involve:
   * **Reviewing the details:** Determine the cause of the variance (e.g., missing items, damage, incorrect records).
   * **Taking Corrective Action:** Adjusting stock levels, investigating discrepancies, and documenting the findings.
   * **Finalizing the Update:** Confirming the stock update and closing out the "C3 journey."

**In summary, to provide accurate instructions, I need more details regarding the specific system you are using, the meaning of terms like "The Open One," "End Term," "NNI SKV," and the exact labels of the buttons you are clicking.**
