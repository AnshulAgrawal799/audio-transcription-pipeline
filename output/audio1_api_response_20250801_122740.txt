Okay, I understand. You're describing a new process for closing stock involving wastage and QR code scanning, implemented with a "1x1" timing. Here's a breakdown of the steps and some potential implications:

**The New Closing Stock Process:**

1. **Open Closing Stock Function:** You begin by accessing the module/functionality within your system that handles closing stock procedures.

2. **Wastage Recording (Before FN Week Mode):**
   *  **Wastage First:**  The first task is to specifically record and process any wastage that occurred during the period.
   *  **FN Week Mode Activation:**  After recording the initial wastage, you activate "FN Week Mode." (The meaning of "FN Week Mode" is unclear without further context, but it seems to be a specific setting or period of time within your system. It could refer to a particular promotional week, financial reporting period, or other defined timeframe.)

3. **Wastage Update (After FN Week Mode):** Once FN Week Mode is active, you may need to update the wastage figures again. This could be for several reasons:
   * **Additional Wastage During FN Week:** Wastage may have occurred specifically *during* the FN Week, needing separate tracking.
   * **Wastage Adjustment for FN Week Promotions:** If FN Week involves promotions or special handling, the method of accounting for wastage may change.  This may require a further manual wastage update step after FN week mode is turned on.

4. **Bonus Inventory Consideration:** You mentioned the availability of bonus inventory.  This is likely inventory that was given as part of a promotion, or other non-standard form of inventory that is not purchased.

5. **QR Code Scanning and Final Closing Stock Update:**
    * **QR Code Scanning:**  After the wastage updates and the completion of FN Week Mode processes, you begin scanning QR codes.  These codes presumably identify individual stock items.
    * **"1x1" Timing:** You want to execute this process with "1x1" timing.

**Understanding "1x1" Timing:**

The phrase "1x1 timing" is vague, but here are the most likely interpretations:

*   **Item-by-Item Processing:** This could mean processing each item and updating the stock count individually and immediately upon scanning its QR code. You're not batching items or deferring the update.
*   **One-Day Processing:** It could also relate to a constraint to complete the closing stock within a single day of the week or time block.
*   **Quick Turnaround/Limited Time:** It might simply mean that the process needs to be completed as quickly and efficiently as possible.

**Key Questions to Clarify (If Possible):**

To fully understand and implement this new process, you need clarification on:

*   **What is "FN Week Mode?"**  Its purpose and how it affects wastage accounting are crucial.
*   **Why do we need to update wastage *before* and *after* FN Week Mode?** What causes the difference?
*   **Specifically, what actions are taken during the wastage updates?** (e.g., manual entry, automated process, etc.)
*   **What is the exact meaning of "1x1 timing"?** The most precise definition will determine how the QR code scanning and stock updates are performed.
*   **How does the bonus inventory factor into this whole process**  Is it separate from the standard inventory, and how does FN Week mode affect the bonus inventory?

**Potential Challenges:**

*   **Time Constraints:**  The "1x1" timing, especially if it means item-by-item processing, could be time-consuming, particularly with a large inventory.
*   **Accuracy:**  Manual wastage updates are prone to error.  Clear procedures and training are vital.
*   **System Integration:**  Ensure the QR code scanning system integrates smoothly with your inventory management software.  The system needs to correctly update stock levels and wastage records.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Get Clarification:**  Speak with the person who introduced this new process and ask the clarifying questions listed above.  Ensure you fully understand the reasoning behind each step.
2.  **Create a Step-by-Step Guide:**  Write a detailed guide outlining each action, including screenshots or diagrams if possible.
3.  **Training:**  Provide thorough training to all staff involved in the closing stock process.
4.  **Testing:**  Perform thorough testing to identify any potential issues or errors before implementing the process live.
5.  **Monitoring:**  Monitor the process closely after implementation to ensure it's running smoothly and accurately.
